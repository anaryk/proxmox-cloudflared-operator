# pco network list

List the networks pco reaches through a leg: the id, the kind (attach, or managed for pco's
own network), the bridge, the VLAN, the prefix of the guests, the address of the leg on this
node, how the gateway last found the leg, and how many routes the last cycle served through
it.

With `--json` the answer of the daemon is printed as the daemon sent it, re-indented, with
control and bidirectional characters escaped.

It asks the daemon through its socket, which answers only root and pco-web, the user of the
web interface; the exit status is 2 when the daemon could not be asked.

## Usage

```text
pco network list [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
# The networks attached

# As JSON, for a script

```

## Flags
